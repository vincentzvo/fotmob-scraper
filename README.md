# FotMob Scraper ⚽

A powerful Python-based web scraper for extracting detailed football match data and statistics from FotMob. Built with Selenium and Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly interface to scrape data by round or for an entire season.

## 🌟 Features

-   **Scrape Matches Only**: Quickly get a list of matches for a specific round (Date, Teams, Score, Status).
-   **Scrape Matches & Stats (Round)**: Get detailed statistics for every match in a selected round.
    -   Includes: Possession, xG, Shots, Passes, Defense, Duels, and more.
-   **Scrape Matches & Stats (Season)**: Scrape data for an entire season (Rounds 1-38).
    -   *Note: This process takes time as it scrapes ~380 matches.*
-   **Pagination**: Easily navigate through large datasets with a paginated table view.
-   **CSV Export**: Download the full scraped dataset (matches + detailed stats) as a CSV file.
-   **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth and responsive user experience.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

## ⚠️ Important Notes

-   **Scraping Time**: Scraping detailed stats for a full season involves visiting ~380 individual match pages. This process can take a significant amount of time (potentially hours depending on your connection). The app provides a progress bar to track the status.
-   **Headless Mode**: The browser runs in headless mode (invisible) by default for efficiency.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Please be respectful of the website's resources.
